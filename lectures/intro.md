# Python Programming for Economics and Finance

This website presents a set of lectures on Python programming for economics and finance, designed and written by
[Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/). This is the first text in the series, which focuses on programming in Python.

```{admonition} News
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) is moving to use the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
build system for all of its projects. We are a founding member of the
[executable books organization](https://github.com/executablebooks) and this
is the first in the QuantEcon lecture series to make this migration. We hope you like it -- if you have any
feedback please let us know at contact@quantecon.org
```

For an overview of the series, see [this page](https://quantecon.org/python-lectures/)
